### Project Approach
Answer project questions as you go along
1. Audience questions + sketch
2. Check + prep data (acquire, parse, filter)
3. Mine/explore/sketch/iterate several simple graphics, re: stories (same or diff?), pick one
4. Code initial draft (pseudo first?)
5. Refine/declutter/clean/annotate/clarify (color, labels, titles, legend, summary, etc)
6. Interactivity (more than tooltips, eg: scrolling)
7. Share
